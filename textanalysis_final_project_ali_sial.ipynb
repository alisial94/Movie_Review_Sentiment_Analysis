      " Ehrenreich hasn't failed Solo: A Star Wars Story. The truth, I daresay, is exactly the opposite.\n",
      "Review 7: \n",
      " No doubt Harrison Ford's Han Solo would casually dismiss this adequately fun origin story with a wink and a wry smile.\n",
      "Review 8: \n",
      " It's got a couple of gasps, a lot of action and a built-in Star Wars audience, pretty much everything a movie needs except one: a compelling reason for being.\n",
      "Review 9: \n",
      " It's a dazzling affair that captures the whimsy and tactility of the original trilogy arguably better than any of the other Disney-era Star Wars flicks.\n",
      "Review 10: \n",
      " Solo is also the most lighthearted and fun film so far in the expanded Star Wars universe.\n",
      "Review 11: \n",
      " Strip away the nostalgia, the familiar Star Wars backdrop and take it for what it's worth, and \"Solo\" is a bit of a clunker.\n",

      " Best of all, the movie is different.\n",
      "Review 13: \n",
      " It's checklist mythology, but thankfully served up with enough panache to make the trip engaging.\n",
      "Review 14: \n",
      " No light sabres are on display and nor is there any sign of Darth Vader but Solo: A Star Wars delivers exactly what you want and expect from a movie about the young Han Solo.\n",
      "Review 15: \n",
      " \"Solo\" is not an awful movie, it just has a few awful parts that feel uninspired.\n",
      "Review 16: \n",

      "Review 17: \n",

      "Review 18: \n",
      " Solo: A Star Wars Storyis a film that gives us Han Solo's cinematic origin story while staying true to the original Star Wars trilogy.\n",
      "Review 19: \n",
      " \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" gets the job done with little fuss, but also with precious little finesse.\n",
      "Review 20: \n",
      " Solo is technically a Star Wars movie, but it's one that has set pieces in place of a personality. It's a film whose base level is \"fine\". Despite some unique cinematography, Ron Howard's direction is staid, stolid, and completely without personality.\n",
      "Review 21: \n",
      " Howard and the Kasdans play the series game without ever raising the stakes, defaulting to dull and dutiful when they might have blasted off into creative anarchy.\n",
      "Review 22: \n",
      " Far better than we had any right to expect. Thrilling set-pieces, spine-tingling iconography and a Han/Chewie bromance to savour.\n",
      "Review 23: \n",
      " Solo: A Star Wars Story is a great heist movie and an underwhelming origin story.\n",
      "Review 24: \n",
      " A slick, swift-footed adventure which plays like a planet-hopping heist movie.\n",
      "Review 25: \n",
      " Although the action can feel at times curiously low-stakes, Solo: A Star Wars Story is an all-round diverting foray into a galaxy, far, far away which doesn't take itself too seriously.\n",
      "Review 26: \n",
      " A spectacularly exciting journey with terrific casting and loads of fan service that will honestly probably make even novices with the lore smile, but the prequels do need to find a better middle ground between fan service and taking storytelling risks\n",
      "Review 27: \n",
      " It's merely a solidly made, fun adventure in the company of familiar characters.\n",
      "Review 28: \n",
      " In an age when our blockbusters feel more pointlessly busy and somber than ever, [Solo] just might come as a relief.\n",
      "Review 29: \n",
      " Solo will please fans, if not necessarily astound them, and leave them anticipating how the story will connect with the original Star Wars saga.\n",
      "Review 30: \n",
      " Though \"Solo\" finishes with a satisfying sense of arrival, the movie leaves room for a sequel, and it may be the best measure of this movie's ultimate quality that the idea of another one of these sounds fun.\n",
      "Review 31: \n",
      " With [Ron] Howard at the controls, the movie is a fun-fuelled entertainment.\n",
      "Review 32: \n",
      " Solo is 'prequel bad,' and as anyone who really loves this franchise knows, there aren't a lot of things worse.\n",
      "Review 33: \n",
      " As an intergalactic adventure, it's mostly adequate, with some very successful elements, but if you stripped the Star Wars names and places, it's doubtful that it would spawn much excitement, let alone sequels.\n",
      "Review 34: \n",
      " Operating in a middle-ground register that's defined by its bland safeness, he sturdily shoulders the weight of the chaotic material...in a role that demands greatness, he is, in a word, okay.\n",
      "Review 35: \n",
      " Sorry, \"Star Wars\" fans: The first dud of the new series has arrived in \"Solo: A Star Wars Story.\"\n",
      "Review 36: \n",
      " The imprint of Star Wars on everyday American life now feels so despotic that it's too much to ask a film like Solo to be moving or thrilling as a piece of cinema.\n",
      "Review 37: \n",
      " While Solo is a Star Wars movie that gambles on not really being a \"Star Wars movie,\" it's a winning chapter that only sparingly (though intriguingly) shows its hand in connecting to the bigger universe.\n",
      "Review 38: \n",
      " A fun, if lightweight space Western, made slightly serious by an equal rights - for humans, Wookiees, even droids - subtext.\n",
      "Review 39: \n",
      " Solo doesn't break new ground, but with an adventure this fun, that's just fine.\n",
      "Review 40: \n",
      " Overall, don't get a bad feeling about this. You may even laugh it up, fuzzball.\n",
      "Review 41: \n",
      " It may be a prequel, and it may ostensibly stand alone, but it fits into the wider galaxy with ease.\n",
      "Review 42: \n",
      " An entertaining two-+ hours.\n",
      "Review 43: \n",
      " It gets off to a slow, muddy, grimly predictable start-but Solo is ultimately, thankfully, one of the good ones.\n",
      "Review 44: \n",
      " While \"Solo\" hasn't completely overcome the long odds, those harboring a love of the franchise should come away, ultimately, with a good feeling about this.\n",
      "Review 45: \n",
      " Solo is not a bad film, just a relentlessly average one that has no reason to exist.\n",
      "Review 46: \n",
      " \"Solo\" is a straightforward piece of pulpy entertainment with some very agreeable performances from [Alden] Ehrenreich and [Donald] Glover, who seems to be having the most fun of all the actors...\n",
      "Review 47: \n",
      " The relationship between Lando and Han feels designed for a Star Wars generation that wants to see more between its characters - especially those embedded in Star Wars lore who might appear in the next decade of sequels.\n",
      "Review 48: \n",
      " Because it sets its sights lower, its aim is truer. It may not look like much - but it's got it where it counts.\n",
      "Review 49: \n",

      " If you've ever wondered who Han Solo was and where he came from - this scruffy, adventurous prequel supplies the answers.\n",
      "Review 473: \n",
      " Han and Chewie heading into warp speed (then flashback) might have provided the early bolt the first act sorely needs. Still. it's an OK space vehicle for anyone but 'Star Wars' junkies likely expecting a better ride.\n",

      " Ron Howard delivers a rip roarin' single in the Star Wars saga with this entertaining origin story of Han Solo, Chewy, and Lando.\n",
      "Review 479: \n",
      " It wasn't necessary to fill in all the gaps about Han Solo's life before Luke Skywalker enlists his help in a Tattooine cantina, but the movie exists anyway, and it's a whole lot better than most cinematic prequels.\n",

      "Review 491: \n",
      " Considering its production history and the fact that most \"origin\" films are inherently blasÃ©, \"Solo\" acquits itself quite nicely. Maybe it doesn't add a great deal to the mythology, but for fans of the space western genre, it's solid entertainment.\n",
      "Review 492: \n",
      " It's good enough. Like Rogue One, it features scene stealing droid. Train robbery sequence is a highlight. Kessel Run not so much.\n",

      "Review 494: \n",
      " Young Han can only watch helplessly as the gravity of the Star Wars children's crusade overwhelms him and the wondrous fun run gives way to a joyless slog that actually undermines the heroism of A New Hope even as it seeks to foreshadow it.\n",

      " Satisfying, action-packed prequel explores Han's roots.\n",
      "Review 496: \n",

      "Review 500: \n",

      " Whenever \"Star Wars\" tries to develop one of the franchise's key characters, it whiffs. \"Solo\" is no exception, a disappointment on par with \"The Last Jedi\" and the prequels.\n",
      "Review 504: \n",
      " Breezy and forgettable, Solo reveals the franchise coasting on autopilot with only one woke character to spoil the fun.\n",
      "Review 505: \n",
      " Han is a character that is all about living on the edge, playing the risk/reward angles. And this film doesn't take enough risks to be completely rewarding.\n",

      " ...A fun and exciting, though imperfect, addition to the Star Wars array. 'Solo' is well worth seeing, particularly for fans.\n",
      "Review 508: \n",
      " If the resulting film isn't as zesty as The Last Jedi, it at least provides a solid night of thrills and chills - which was what George Lucas's original Star Wars was supposed to be about, anyway.\n",
      "Review 509: \n",
      " Solo is at its best when it's uncoupled from all that heavy lifting, just crammed in a cockpit with its likeable cast and shooting for the stars.\n",
      "Review 510: \n",
      " The story may be slight but it's propulsive enough and enjoyable enough to be a fine Star Wars movie in its own right - a far cry from the sterile prequels it invokes in a sop to younger fans.\n",
      "Review 511: \n",
      " It's a rite-of-passage movie about what it takes this free spirited rebel - a reckless kid more concerned with impressing a girl rather than igniting the spark that will eventually fuel the rebellion - to become the character we know and love.\n",
      "Review 512: \n",
      " While the film is titled, \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" it should have been called \"Solo and Chewie: A Star Wars Bromance\" because it is their relationship that is the heart and soul of this story.\n",
      "Review 513: \n",
      " The film is at its thriving best when the screen is filled by the potpourri of personality that orbits the pivotal pilot of the title.\n",
      "Review 514: \n",
      " Even if most of the plot's twists and turns are fairly obvious, it's amusing to watch the balance of power shift between the characters. And no one is just along for the ride.\n",

      "Review 886: \n",
      " [Director Rian Johnson's] movie has a sense of humor about itself and a sense of joy, but its emotional generosity, even in the midst of all the extravagant green-screen work, is its best special effect.\n",
      "Review 887: \n",
      " The spectacles in Star Wars: The Last Jedi are some of the most powerful and believable in the franchises.\n",
      "Review 888: \n",
      " Star Wars: The Last Jedi launches the franchise to another level of action and humor thanks to incoming writer-director Rian Johnson, whose imagination seems boundless as George Lucas' 40 years ago.\n",
      "Review 889: \n",
      " You don't have to be a Star Wars fan to love this addition to the canon (heck, it works even if you haven't seen any of the other movies).\n",
      "Review 890: \n",
      " In short, it feels like a new hope.\n",
      "Review 891: \n",

      "Review 892: \n",
      " Johnson has delivered the goods: a film that isn't afraid to be ambitious, that delights and dazzles in equal measure, while providing a worthwhile emotional investment. It is a crowd-pleaser that will be wholeheartedly embraced by fans.\n",
      "Review 893: \n",
      " It soars and sinks, shrewdly building on franchise lore while scoring cheap shots against capitalism. Frustrating it is, hmmm?\n",
      "Review 894: \n",
      " As indebted to the previous installments and \"Star Wars\" canon as it is to classic Westerns, sword-and-sandal epics and martial arts films.... it's the blend of reverence for its roots and embrace of the new that makes \"The Last Jedi\" a triumph.\n",
      "Review 895: \n",
      " A stunning black, white, and red color pallette, thrilling adventure, appealing new characters, worthy developments for old friends and a cause to root for.\n",
      "Review 896: \n",
      " Star Wars fans, your sky high expectations are rewarded. Rian Johnson takes the fabled lore from a galaxy far away into uncharted territory. He will have you spellbound.\n",
      "Review 897: \n",
      " The movie comes off as a work that's ironed out, flattened down, appallingly purified.\n",
      "Review 898: \n",
      " Rian Johnson clearly remembers something that Lucas' most fervent followers sometimes forget: These are movies for the young, or at least the young at heart.\n",
      "Review 899: \n",
      " The Last Jedi is that very rare thing, a brilliantly crafted, intelligent blockbuster that will deserve every penny of its doubtless immense box-office returns.\n",
      "Review 900: \n",
      " Efficiently manufactured and enjoyable enough but overloaded with action and effects, and sorely lacking the magic that marked the first movies in the franchise.\n",
      "Review 901: \n",
      " The Last Jedi boasts many very good performances, ones that enrich the characters and which salute writer/director Johnson's ability to find the humanity within technology, something he proved early on with his artful time-travel thriller Looper.\n",
      "Review 902: \n",
      " A blockbuster with the beating heart of its creator worn proudly on its sleeve.\n",
      "Review 903: \n",

      "Review 904: \n",
      " A spectacular, full-throttle joyride of thrills, exhilarating, screen-filling visuals, emotional heft and humor, with familiar characters and new faces we'll almost certainly be seeing again.\n",
      "Review 905: \n",
      " The Last Jedi may not be a flawless film but continues to push the story forward. The film has a lot going for it and Rian Johnson seems to understand exactly what Star Wars fans are looking for.\n",
      "Review 906: \n",
      " Star Wars: The Last Jedi builds upon Star Wars history for a more expansive, high-stakes adventure with plenty of fresh - and classic - elements.\n",

      " Without giving away any surprises, there will be endearing reunions, unexpected appearances and outcomes. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Review 908: \n",
      " There's a trick to taking something old and making it bigger and more impressive, yet familiar enough to sate our desire for the same. With Last Jedi, Johnson pulls it off assuredly enough to please nearly everybody.\n",
      "Review 909: \n",
      " The Last Jedi, however, opens up some new possibilities. It doesn't provide a ton of satisfying answers, but it creates some interesting questions. And it manages to make \"Star Wars\" feel new again.\n",
      "Review 910: \n",
      " Perhaps like no film in the franchise yet, 'The Last Jedi' seriously considers the hubris that comes with certainty, and how knots from the past that can keep you bound from moving forward.\n",
      "Review 911: \n",
      " While the central story concept of THE LAST JEDI, Luke's Dharmic apotheosis and Rey's Gnostic enlightenment, is a brilliant one, it's hounded by lopsided execution and a ham-fisted subplot...\n",
      "Review 912: \n",
      " Every moment where The Last Jedi almost takes a bold risk for the series, it undermines itself to maintain the status quo.\n",
      "Review 913: \n",
      " Disney found a true \"Star Wars\" champion in Johnson and I'm eager to see what he does when he's able to craft the next trilogy from scratch.\n",
      "Review 914: \n",
      " \"The Last Jedi\" may not possess its immediate predecessors' pleasant shock of the new, nor is it a stylistic detour from what's expected. But it makes up for this with wit, spirit and one wicked saber smackdown.\n",
      "Review 915: \n",
      " It's a film of genuine beauty, one where you come away as eager to talk about the set design and the choreography as you do the fate of the galaxy or what might happen next.\n",
      "Review 916: \n",
      " \"The Last Jedi\" is a rousing, stirring adventure that is consistently guided by the courage and fallibility of its characters, culminating in a sustained, riveting finale that overpowers any quibbles about pacing and plotting.\n",
      "Review 917: \n",
      " [Johnson's]often-stirring addition to the saga finally lands on an affecting point about the importance of preserving essential cultural tradition without clinging too strictly to the dogma -- and the texts -- of the old way.\n",

      " Fans can expect plenty of surprises and awe-inspiring visual wizardry.\n",
      "Review 919: \n",
      " After this - I never thought I'd say it - I'm up for more. Bring on the next Star Wars.\n",
      "Review 920: \n",
      " The first half of the movie works in fits and starts, but Johnson makes up for it in the second, when the bundle of subplots intertwine tighter, and the narrative rockets forward, its action fleet of foot and tightly tied to its emotional highs.\n",
      "Review 921: \n",
      " Everything a fan could want from a Star Wars film and then some.\n",
      "Review 922: \n",
      " [Rian] Johnson's passion ends up giving wings to these last Jedi who, although wounded and disenchanted, resist stronger than ever. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Review 923: \n",
      " While there are elements nodding to The Empire Strikes Back, The Last Jedi is no copycat. In its most daring moments, it even tweaks a few series tropes, updating them with a decidedly populist kick.\n",
      "Review 924: \n",
      " Writer-director Rian Johnson has certainly made the busiest Star Wars film of them all, but he keeps it from becoming a slog by infusing it with humor, verve, and visual charm.\n",
      "Review 925: \n",
      " Splits its attentions between two threads, but only half delivers spectacularly with heart, thrills, and some truly beautiful story beats while the other limps through space.\n",
      "Review 926: \n",
      " \"The Last Jedi\" has as much heart as it has guts and that's a stirring combination. You walk out of the cinema reminded why it's sometimes worth fighting a battle you may well lose.\n",
      "Review 927: \n",
      " Rian Johnson's main feat is being savvy enough to know that sometimes the best thing to do is cherishing the past before burning it to the ground.\n",
      "Review 928: \n",
      " But gradually, Johnson's many additions become too much of a good thing and The Last Jedi grows crowded, busy and long.\n",

      " Falsely epic, uselessly lyrical. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Review 930: \n",
      " But for the most part, [Rian] Johnson pulls it off with a unique take on all of those key Star Wars staples, which he fills with humor and childlike imagination-creating so many moments when the audience erupted in cheers.\n",
      "Review 931: \n",
      " Last Jedi is deep. It's also rollicking. It's right up there with the very first Star Wars in terms of its enjoyability factor. It's a triumph.\n",
      "Review 932: \n",
      " When everything pulls in the same direction, as it does consistently in \"The Last Jedi,\" it's like watching a mind-boggling clockwork click into a deft ballet.\n",
      "Review 933: \n",
      " That said, I'd stop short of calling director Rian Johnson's undeniably impressive initiation into the Star Wars fold the masterpiece that some desperately want it to be. The film simply drags too much in the middle.\n",
      "Review 934: \n",
      " You cannot kill the past. What you can do is build on it to enable an intriguing future. At the very least, The Last Jedi does that.\n",
      "Review 935: \n",
      " [Carrie Fisher] is luminous here. Every time she's on screen, it's impossible to look away, and she is as tough, loving, and wily as we would ever want our Leia to be.\n",
      "Review 936: \n",
      " The emotional pay-offs are huge, the visuals are stunning, the performances are brilliant and, even as it eagerly explores the darkness, The Last Jedi never loses sight of its heart.\n",
      "Review 937: \n",
      " \"The Last Jedi\" is the best directed, most beautiful-looking \"Star Wars\" movie since \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"\n",
      "Review 938: \n",
      " 'The Last Jedi' walks a fine line for fans, creating a solid standalone film that shines within the franchise canon.\n",
      "Review 939: \n",
      " It feels fresh, exciting and playful, without losing the operatic grandeur Star Wars thrives upon.\n",
      "Review 940: \n",
      " If Star Wars: The Last Jedi isn't a complete deconstruction of the original trilogy, it's at least an acknowledgement that these archetypical characters must evolve in order to survive.\n",
      "Review 941: \n",
      " It's not a perfect movie by any means; some of the comedy is a little too silly and one or two of the plot threads feel a bit less important than the others, but these quibbles were minor when compared to the parts that work. Those REALLY work.\n",
      "Review 942: \n",
      " The Last Jedi at its heart is a love letter to a childhood. From Luke's sly wink to an old friend to General Leia's leadership, the familiar heroes dominate the screen, earn the biggest applause and serve as a compass to the next generation.\n",
      "Review 943: \n",
      " The Last Jedi opens up with one of the best space fights the series has seen, and it carries that quality throughout. It has one of the best light saber fights, one of the best endings, and some of the most fun the series has seen.\n",
      "Review 944: \n",
      " It provides top-drawer popcorn entertainment for the casual cinema goer, while hardcore fans will love it for the respect it has for the franchise history and for what it promises for the future.\n",

      "Review 946: \n",
      " This is a GREAT Star Wars movie, possibly the best. It's certainly more satisfying and easily the most emotional.\n",
      "Review 947: \n",
      " This mid-section marker in the current trilogy simply doesn't disappoint, realising the courage of its convictions with an intelligent story and a heart-swelling emotional resonance.\n",
      "Review 948: \n",
      " The Last Jedi is a top-of-the-line, A-+ Star Wars and scifi movie -- one that we'll be watching and discussing for as long as there's a galaxy far, far away.\n",
      "Review 949: \n",
      " The movie suffers a little from uneven pacing and occasionally lost my focus here and there but it is a worthy addition to the canon.\n",

      " Mark Hamill has never been better in his interpretation of Luke Skywalker. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Review 952: \n",
      " An excellent middle chapter bursting with wit, wisdom, emotion, shocks, old-fashioned derring-do, state-of-the-art tech, and stonking set-pieces.\n",
      "Review 953: \n",
      " Taken as a whole, this eighth episode of the franchise will be porgnip for the faithful, though the answer to one of its Big Questions seems disappointing, and generously entertaining for the rest of us.\n",
      "Review 954: \n",
      " For those hoping that there may have been a substantial uptick in quality between J.J. Abrams's The Force Awakens and Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi-in much the same way that The Empire Strikes Back improved on Star Wars-you may need a new hope.\n",
      "Review 955: \n",
      " When the feelings come in The Last Jedi, and they do come, they're deep and they're real. Go ahead and try to watch the penultimate scene without crying, or pretending not to. And may the Force be with you.\n",
      "Review 956: \n",
      " It took them 40 years, but they've finally done it. The best Star Wars film of the series. There. That's it. It's that simple.\n",
      "Review 957: \n",
      " It supplies us with all the things we expect - nay, demand - in a Star Wars movie, and manages to surprise us by revealing that this fictional universe, in which we've already clocked so many hours, can still surprise us.\n",

      " The future of the galaxy has never been in safer hands.\n",
      "Review 959: \n",
      " Propped up by strong material, every member of the Star Wars: The Last Jedi cast delivers performances worthy of the iconic franchise, but deserving special mention is Mark Hamill.\n",
      "Review 960: \n",
      " It certainly captures the sense of awe and imagination of what we love best about that universe. While it's not entirely without faults, it is entirely entertaining.\n",
      "Review 961: \n",
      " Star Wars has been with us for four decades now, telling that same essential story in a format that's overwhelming and engulfing. With wit, skill, and love, The Last Jedi takes up the torch and carries it for a new generation.\n",
      "Review 962: \n",
      " By breaking down some of the old mythology, [Rian] Johnson has staked out new territory. For the first time in a long time, a \"Star Wars\" film feels forward-moving.\n",
      "Review 963: \n",
      " The Last Jedi works on several levels, but most importantly it's a rip-roaring good time. That's what Star Wars fans want the most, and that's what they get with this dynamite installment.\n",
      "Review 964: \n",
      " Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the perfect antidote to the year that is 2017 and introduces the tonic for what we need to enter 2018: hope.\n",
      "Review 965: \n",
      " Sure, The Last Jedi can occasionally be too goofy or free-roaming for its own good, but it's an impossible film to sit in front of and not have a good time.\n",
      "Review 966: \n",
      " Time and again, [Rian] Johnson finds a cinematic grammar that feels new to Star Wars; big close-ups (tender touching hands), top shots, elegant camera tracks and pulling out in-world sound, leaving just music and image.\n",
      "Review 967: \n",
      " The Last Jedi is funny, it's emotional, it's fast-paced and it has a good story to tell.\n",
      "Review 968: \n",
      " ... The Last Jedi challenges itself with moments that, if mishandled, could easily have tainted beloved Star Wars moments in the same way that many people feel the prequel trilogy did. Instead, it navigates those narrative rapids with aplomb.\n",
      "Review 969: \n",
      " [Rian] Johnson's ability to deliver a fresh and engaging riff on this beast of an enterprise suggests that not every free-spirited storyteller can be corrupted by Hollywood's dark side, and some may even give it a new hope.\n",
      "Review 970: \n",
      " The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back, and is awful close to being its equal.\n",
      "Review 971: \n",
      " You don't see many sci-fi action extravaganzas that are about late middle-aged disappointment, about wondering what it's all about and whether any of it was worth it. It's this element that gives \"The Last Jedi\" an extra something ...\n",
      "Review 972: \n",
      " A nuanced, touching, humorous adventure, laced with thrilling space battles and some jaw-dropping visuals.\n",
      "Review 973: \n",

      "Review 975: \n",
      " The Force is, to me, still silly Star Wars mumbo jumbo, but Johnson finds a way to underscore it with humanity, with a classical Greek rumble of true pathos.\n",
      "Review 976: \n",
      " The Last Jedi, unlike its predecessor, has the freedom to be daring, and perhaps the most thrilling thing about it-and there are many, many thrilling things-is how abundantly it takes advantage of that freedom.\n",

      "Review 979: \n",
      " Everything is respected, but nothing is sacred. It's a sweeping gut-punch. How it deals with our own hopes and dreams for these characters, and how deep it cuts into existential concerns that drive us all - its effects will run around in the mind.\n",
      "Review 980: \n",
      " A fresh visual style makes this middle \"Star Wars\" a welcome addition to the saga.\n",
      "Review 981: \n",
      " No matter how many exotic creatures & internecine struggles that galaxy far away may accommodate, it is a remarkably closed system, reechoing the same themes across the ages, & preferring regression & eternal return to anything like real progress.\n",
      "Review 982: \n",
      " Every new Star Wars movie since Disney bought Lucasfilm has been heralded as the first worthy successor to the Original Trilogy, but with The Last Jedi it's finally true.\n",

      " This is grand powerful entertainment, and one of the finest films in the Star Wars Saga.\n",

      " The Last Jedi is a very satisfying entry into the Star Wars Saga with some fantastic, jaw-dropping moments.\n",
      "Review 991: \n",
      " That's not to say Star Wars: The Last Jedi will go down in history as a better movie than the franchise's gold standard, The Empire Strikes Back, but director Rian Johnson has pulled off a complete rejuvenation of the saga.\n",
      "Review 992: \n",
      " 'The Last Jedi' is not a great movie because it's a 'Star Wars' film. It reasserts 'Star Wars' as a top-tier blockbuster franchise by being a great movie.\n",
      "Review 993: \n",
      " Writer/director Rian Johnson's entry into the Star Wars canon is rebelliously bold at times and full of rousing surprises, which make up for a few lulls in the lengthy two-and-a-half-hour run time.\n",
      "Review 994: \n",

      "Review 999: \n",
      " Optimistically, The Last Jedi leaves plenty of intriguing possibilities for the climactic installment. But there's also the kind of room for improvement that remind us when it comes to Star Wars, such hopes -- new or otherwise -- spring eternal.\n",

      "Review 1005: \n",
      " It is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever).\n",
      "Review 1006: \n",
      " Loaded with action and satisfying in the ways its loyal audience wants it to be ... generally pleasing even as it sometimes strains to find useful and/or interesting things for some of its characters to do.\n",
      "Review 1007: \n",

      " Johnson has crafted such a powerful, screaming geekgasm of a movie.\n",
      "Review 1012: \n",
      " The Last Jedi gives you an explosive sugar rush of spectacle. It's a film that buzzes with belief in itself and its own mythic universe - a euphoric certainty that I think no other movie franchise has.\n",
      "Review 1013: \n",
      " The most intelligent film in the franchise by several light years, The Last Jedi can be seen as the space-opera equivalent of Clint Eastwood's revisionist western, Unforgiven.\n",
      "Review 1014: \n",
      " The miracle of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is its rejection of series formality. Writer/director Rian Johnson manages to honor mythology while also having fun disrupting it.\n",

      "Review 1016: \n",
      " The Last Jedi goes big on identity, confusion and loss as [Rian] Johnson puts characters through the existential wringer like no Star Wars director before him.\n",
      "Review 1017: \n",
      " Rian Johnson's Episode VIII is a true space opera-a masterful blend of humor, fun, and pathos that bares the souls of its characters and pushes the franchise to new heights.\n",

      "Review 1023: \n",
      " This is the longest movie in the franchise. It just doesn't feel that way. I haven't been this into a Star Wars picture since the Empire struck back in The Empire Strikes Back.\n",
      "Review 1024: \n",
      " Rolling up with the kind of intergalactic swagger that gives us a cosmically infuriating phone prank within the first five minutes, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a work of supreme confidence: witty, wild and free to roam unexplored territory.\n",
      "Review 1025: \n",
      " Rian Johnson has made a film that will delight and divide fans in equal measure. It is a bold and brilliant new step for the saga, moments of inspired silliness, pure heartbreak and thrilling action.\n",

      "Review 1035: \n",
      " This is a movie not only for Star Wars fans but also for fans of losing themselves in, and falling in love with, blockbuster movies. That's a feeling most Hollywood movies have forgotten-and The Last Jedi is here to make us remember it.\n",
      "Review 1036: \n",
      " While familiar, this is a Star Wars film that isn't overly beholden to its past, playing with the tropes, themes, and characters of its predecessors in a way that is both unsettling but necessary.\n",
      "Review 1037: \n",
      " [Director Rian Johnson's] movie has a sense of humor about itself and a sense of joy, but its emotional generosity, even in the midst of all the extravagant green-screen work, is its best special effect.\n",

      "Review 1044: \n",
      " It soars and sinks, shrewdly building on franchise lore while scoring cheap shots against capitalism. Frustrating it is, hmmm?\n",
      "Review 1045: \n",
      " As indebted to the previous installments and \"Star Wars\" canon as it is to classic Westerns, sword-and-sandal epics and martial arts films.... it's the blend of reverence for its roots and embrace of the new that makes \"The Last Jedi\" a triumph.\n",

      "Review 1060: \n",
      " The Last Jedi, however, opens up some new possibilities. It doesn't provide a ton of satisfying answers, but it creates some interesting questions. And it manages to make \"Star Wars\" feel new again.\n",
      "Review 1061: \n",
      " Perhaps like no film in the franchise yet, 'The Last Jedi' seriously considers the hubris that comes with certainty, and how knots from the past that can keep you bound from moving forward.\n",
      "Review 1062: \n",
      " While the central story concept of THE LAST JEDI, Luke's Dharmic apotheosis and Rey's Gnostic enlightenment, is a brilliant one, it's hounded by lopsided execution and a ham-fisted subplot...\n",

      "Review 1064: \n",
      " Disney found a true \"Star Wars\" champion in Johnson and I'm eager to see what he does when he's able to craft the next trilogy from scratch.\n",
      "Review 1065: \n",
      " \"The Last Jedi\" may not possess its immediate predecessors' pleasant shock of the new, nor is it a stylistic detour from what's expected. But it makes up for this with wit, spirit and one wicked saber smackdown.\n",
      "Review 1066: \n",
      " It's a film of genuine beauty, one where you come away as eager to talk about the set design and the choreography as you do the fate of the galaxy or what might happen next.\n",
      "Review 1067: \n",
      " \"The Last Jedi\" is a rousing, stirring adventure that is consistently guided by the courage and fallibility of its characters, culminating in a sustained, riveting finale that overpowers any quibbles about pacing and plotting.\n",

      "Review 1071: \n",
      " The first half of the movie works in fits and starts, but Johnson makes up for it in the second, when the bundle of subplots intertwine tighter, and the narrative rockets forward, its action fleet of foot and tightly tied to its emotional highs.\n",

      " Everything a fan could want from a Star Wars film and then some.\n",

      "Review 1074: \n",
      " While there are elements nodding to The Empire Strikes Back, The Last Jedi is no copycat. In its most daring moments, it even tweaks a few series tropes, updating them with a decidedly populist kick.\n",
      "Review 1075: \n",
      " Writer-director Rian Johnson has certainly made the busiest Star Wars film of them all, but he keeps it from becoming a slog by infusing it with humor, verve, and visual charm.\n",
      "Review 1076: \n",
      " Splits its attentions between two threads, but only half delivers spectacularly with heart, thrills, and some truly beautiful story beats while the other limps through space.\n",
      "Review 1077: \n",
      " \"The Last Jedi\" has as much heart as it has guts and that's a stirring combination. You walk out of the cinema reminded why it's sometimes worth fighting a battle you may well lose.\n",
      "Review 1078: \n",
      " Rian Johnson's main feat is being savvy enough to know that sometimes the best thing to do is cherishing the past before burning it to the ground.\n",

      " But gradually, Johnson's many additions become too much of a good thing and The Last Jedi grows crowded, busy and long.\n",

      " Falsely epic, uselessly lyrical. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Review 1081: \n",
      " But for the most part, [Rian] Johnson pulls it off with a unique take on all of those key Star Wars staples, which he fills with humor and childlike imagination-creating so many moments when the audience erupted in cheers.\n",
      "Review 1082: \n",
      " Last Jedi is deep. It's also rollicking. It's right up there with the very first Star Wars in terms of its enjoyability factor. It's a triumph.\n",
      "Review 1083: \n",
      " When everything pulls in the same direction, as it does consistently in \"The Last Jedi,\" it's like watching a mind-boggling clockwork click into a deft ballet.\n",
      "Review 1084: \n",
      " That said, I'd stop short of calling director Rian Johnson's undeniably impressive initiation into the Star Wars fold the masterpiece that some desperately want it to be. The film simply drags too much in the middle.\n",
      "Review 1085: \n",
      " You cannot kill the past. What you can do is build on it to enable an intriguing future. At the very least, The Last Jedi does that.\n",
      "Review 1086: \n",
      " [Carrie Fisher] is luminous here. Every time she's on screen, it's impossible to look away, and she is as tough, loving, and wily as we would ever want our Leia to be.\n",
      "Review 1087: \n",
      " The emotional pay-offs are huge, the visuals are stunning, the performances are brilliant and, even as it eagerly explores the darkness, The Last Jedi never loses sight of its heart.\n",

      " \"The Last Jedi\" is the best directed, most beautiful-looking \"Star Wars\" movie since \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"\n",
      "Review 1089: \n",
      " 'The Last Jedi' walks a fine line for fans, creating a solid standalone film that shines within the franchise canon.\n",
      "Review 1090: \n",
      " It feels fresh, exciting and playful, without losing the operatic grandeur Star Wars thrives upon.\n",
      "Review 1091: \n",
      " If Star Wars: The Last Jedi isn't a complete deconstruction of the original trilogy, it's at least an acknowledgement that these archetypical characters must evolve in order to survive.\n",
      "Review 1092: \n",
      " It's not a perfect movie by any means; some of the comedy is a little too silly and one or two of the plot threads feel a bit less important than the others, but these quibbles were minor when compared to the parts that work. Those REALLY work.\n",
      "Review 1093: \n",
      " The Last Jedi at its heart is a love letter to a childhood. From Luke's sly wink to an old friend to General Leia's leadership, the familiar heroes dominate the screen, earn the biggest applause and serve as a compass to the next generation.\n",
      "Review 1094: \n",
      " The Last Jedi opens up with one of the best space fights the series has seen, and it carries that quality throughout. It has one of the best light saber fights, one of the best endings, and some of the most fun the series has seen.\n",
      "Review 1095: \n",
      " It provides top-drawer popcorn entertainment for the casual cinema goer, while hardcore fans will love it for the respect it has for the franchise history and for what it promises for the future.\n",

      "Review 1104: \n",
      " Taken as a whole, this eighth episode of the franchise will be porgnip for the faithful, though the answer to one of its Big Questions seems disappointing, and generously entertaining for the rest of us.\n",
      "Review 1105: \n",
      " For those hoping that there may have been a substantial uptick in quality between J.J. Abrams's The Force Awakens and Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi-in much the same way that The Empire Strikes Back improved on Star Wars-you may need a new hope.\n",
      "Review 1106: \n",
      " When the feelings come in The Last Jedi, and they do come, they're deep and they're real. Go ahead and try to watch the penultimate scene without crying, or pretending not to. And may the Force be with you.\n",
      "Review 1107: \n",
      " It took them 40 years, but they've finally done it. The best Star Wars film of the series. There. That's it. It's that simple.\n",
      "Review 1108: \n",
      " It supplies us with all the things we expect - nay, demand - in a Star Wars movie, and manages to surprise us by revealing that this fictional universe, in which we've already clocked so many hours, can still surprise us.\n",

      "Review 1112: \n",
      " Star Wars has been with us for four decades now, telling that same essential story in a format that's overwhelming and engulfing. With wit, skill, and love, The Last Jedi takes up the torch and carries it for a new generation.\n",
      "Review 1113: \n",
      " By breaking down some of the old mythology, [Rian] Johnson has staked out new territory. For the first time in a long time, a \"Star Wars\" film feels forward-moving.\n",
      "Review 1114: \n",
      " The Last Jedi works on several levels, but most importantly it's a rip-roaring good time. That's what Star Wars fans want the most, and that's what they get with this dynamite installment.\n",
      "Review 1115: \n",
      " Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the perfect antidote to the year that is 2017 and introduces the tonic for what we need to enter 2018: hope.\n",
      "Review 1116: \n",
      " Sure, The Last Jedi can occasionally be too goofy or free-roaming for its own good, but it's an impossible film to sit in front of and not have a good time.\n",
      "Review 1117: \n",
      " Time and again, [Rian] Johnson finds a cinematic grammar that feels new to Star Wars; big close-ups (tender touching hands), top shots, elegant camera tracks and pulling out in-world sound, leaving just music and image.\n",
      "Review 1118: \n",
      " The Last Jedi is funny, it's emotional, it's fast-paced and it has a good story to tell.\n",
      "Review 1119: \n",
      " ... The Last Jedi challenges itself with moments that, if mishandled, could easily have tainted beloved Star Wars moments in the same way that many people feel the prequel trilogy did. Instead, it navigates those narrative rapids with aplomb.\n",
      "Review 1120: \n",
      " [Rian] Johnson's ability to deliver a fresh and engaging riff on this beast of an enterprise suggests that not every free-spirited storyteller can be corrupted by Hollywood's dark side, and some may even give it a new hope.\n",

      " The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back, and is awful close to being its equal.\n",
      "Review 1122: \n",
      " You don't see many sci-fi action extravaganzas that are about late middle-aged disappointment, about wondering what it's all about and whether any of it was worth it. It's this element that gives \"The Last Jedi\" an extra something ...\n",

      "Review 1126: \n",
      " The Force is, to me, still silly Star Wars mumbo jumbo, but Johnson finds a way to underscore it with humanity, with a classical Greek rumble of true pathos.\n",
      "Review 1127: \n",
      " The Last Jedi, unlike its predecessor, has the freedom to be daring, and perhaps the most thrilling thing about it-and there are many, many thrilling things-is how abundantly it takes advantage of that freedom.\n",

      "Review 1130: \n",
      " Everything is respected, but nothing is sacred. It's a sweeping gut-punch. How it deals with our own hopes and dreams for these characters, and how deep it cuts into existential concerns that drive us all - its effects will run around in the mind.\n",
      "Review 1131: \n",
      " A fresh visual style makes this middle \"Star Wars\" a welcome addition to the saga.\n",
      "Review 1132: \n",
      " No matter how many exotic creatures & internecine struggles that galaxy far away may accommodate, it is a remarkably closed system, reechoing the same themes across the ages, & preferring regression & eternal return to anything like real progress.\n",

      " Every new Star Wars movie since Disney bought Lucasfilm has been heralded as the first worthy successor to the Original Trilogy, but with The Last Jedi it's finally true.\n",

      "Review 1142: \n",
      " That's not to say Star Wars: The Last Jedi will go down in history as a better movie than the franchise's gold standard, The Empire Strikes Back, but director Rian Johnson has pulled off a complete rejuvenation of the saga.\n",
      "Review 1143: \n",
      " 'The Last Jedi' is not a great movie because it's a 'Star Wars' film. It reasserts 'Star Wars' as a top-tier blockbuster franchise by being a great movie.\n",
      "Review 1144: \n",
      " Writer/director Rian Johnson's entry into the Star Wars canon is rebelliously bold at times and full of rousing surprises, which make up for a few lulls in the lengthy two-and-a-half-hour run time.\n",
      "Review 1145: \n",
      " The Last Jedi provides a resoundingly positive answer to an old smuggler's long-ago query: \"Let's see what this piece of junk can do.\"\n",
      "Review 1146: \n",
      " A more complicated visit to a galaxy far far away, one that manages to be a great stand-alone adventure in its own right.\n",
      "Review 1147: \n",
      " Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the greatest Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back\n",
      "Review 1148: \n",
      " [The film] not only delivers everything fans could want from the sequel but also gives them a whole load of other stuff they never knew they wanted into the bargain.\n",
      "Review 1149: \n",
      " Falls right behind Empire Strikes Back and maybe the original film in providing the thrills and the heartbreak, the heroism and villainy, and the romance and betrayal that makes these films such a treat.\n",
      "Review 1150: \n",
      " Optimistically, The Last Jedi leaves plenty of intriguing possibilities for the climactic installment. But there's also the kind of room for improvement that remind us when it comes to Star Wars, such hopes -- new or otherwise -- spring eternal.\n",
      "Review 1151: \n",
      " A stellar entry that owes much to George Lucas' original films while finding a signature vibe of its own and unleashing a few welcome twists.\n",
      "Review 1152: \n",
      " Star Wars: The Last Jedi is striking, stunning, visually hypnotizing, thrilling - everything \"epic\" about the famed franchise rolled into a tremendously overcharged start to Rian Johnson's Star Wars career.\n",
      "Review 1153: \n",
      " Star Wars: The Last Jedi is weird, wild, emotional, and fantastic.\n",
      "Review 1154: \n",
      " \"I laughed. I cried. I screamed and cheered so much that my throat went raw, and I left the theater on a high of exhilaration.\"\n",
      "Review 1155: \n",
      " One of the strongest aspects of The Last Jedi is its writing. Written and directed by Rian Johnson, he shakes the foundations of The Force and puts everything we think we know to the test.\n",
      "Review 1156: \n",
      " It is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever).\n",
      "Review 1157: \n",
      " Loaded with action and satisfying in the ways its loyal audience wants it to be ... generally pleasing even as it sometimes strains to find useful and/or interesting things for some of its characters to do.\n",
      "Review 1158: \n",
      " This is the first Star Wars movie made by an artist instead of a craftsman, and it leaves us on the verge of something new. I'm very, very excited to see what that might be.\n",
      "Review 1159: \n",
      " Still, this is no mere placeholder of a story. Huge, important things happen to characters secondary and primary. Surprises big and small abound.\n",
      "Review 1160: \n",
      " No romance, little pathos and lacks a single heartfelt punch-in-the-gut moment.\n",
      "Review 1161: \n",
      " I'm so thrilled that I'm able to say that Star Wars: The Last Jedi made my heart soar and filled me with happiness. I'm heartened to say that it did our Carrie proud.\n",
      "Review 1162: \n",
      " Johnson has crafted such a powerful, screaming geekgasm of a movie.\n",
      "Review 1163: \n",
      " The Last Jedi gives you an explosive sugar rush of spectacle. It's a film that buzzes with belief in itself and its own mythic universe - a euphoric certainty that I think no other movie franchise has.\n",
      "Review 1164: \n",
      " The most intelligent film in the franchise by several light years, The Last Jedi can be seen as the space-opera equivalent of Clint Eastwood's revisionist western, Unforgiven.\n",
      "Review 1165: \n",
      " The miracle of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is its rejection of series formality. Writer/director Rian Johnson manages to honor mythology while also having fun disrupting it.\n",
      "Review 1166: \n",
      " It may sound like a backhanded compliment, but with so much on the line, Johnson deserves credit for not messing things up.\n",
      "Review 1167: \n",
      " The Last Jedi goes big on identity, confusion and loss as [Rian] Johnson puts characters through the existential wringer like no Star Wars director before him.\n",
      "Review 1168: \n",
      " Rian Johnson's Episode VIII is a true space opera-a masterful blend of humor, fun, and pathos that bares the souls of its characters and pushes the franchise to new heights.\n",

      " The best Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back.\n",
      "Review 1170: \n",
      " Johnson has made something that isn't just a worthy addition to one of the most fan obsessed franchises ever, but is also a powerful standalone story.\n",
      "Review 1171: \n",
      " No one can say that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a previous entry in a different skin as Rian Johnson has crafted an installment that largely defies saga standard narrative structure and tone\n",
      "Review 1172: \n",
      " Rian Johnson has created a movie that is both quintessentially Star Wars and richer than anything that has come before.\n",
      "Review 1173: \n",
      " For all its strengths, The Last Jedi is a very manic film, fueled by excellent ideas that could have been parsed out in smarter ways.\n",
      "Review 1174: \n",
      " This is the longest movie in the franchise. It just doesn't feel that way. I haven't been this into a Star Wars picture since the Empire struck back in The Empire Strikes Back.\n",
      "Review 1175: \n",
      " Rolling up with the kind of intergalactic swagger that gives us a cosmically infuriating phone prank within the first five minutes, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a work of supreme confidence: witty, wild and free to roam unexplored territory.\n",
      "Review 1176: \n",
      " Rian Johnson has made a film that will delight and divide fans in equal measure. It is a bold and brilliant new step for the saga, moments of inspired silliness, pure heartbreak and thrilling action.\n",

      "Review 1178: \n",
      " You may or may not be surprised to learn I do not automatically swoon every time I hear the words 'Star Wars'. But, I'll be damned if I didn't feel a distinctive shiver down my spine watching The Last Jedi.\n",
      "Review 1179: \n",

      "Review 1184: \n",

      "Review 1188: \n",
      " The Last Jedi is everything a Star Wars film should be, and so much more. Johnson weaves an emotionally rewarding tale while balancing all the essential sci-fi action expected.\n",
      "Review 1189: \n",

      " Thankfully The Last Jedi won't be the last Jedi movie, but it should be your next.\n",
      "Review 1194: \n",
      " Fisher would be proud of Episode VIII, an injection of freshness into a series always only one movie away from staidness -- such is the scrutiny of something as loaded as Star Wars.\n",
      "Review 1195: \n",
      " The force is still strong with this one. It just takes the occasional wobble.\n",
      "Review 1196: \n",
      " For all the complexity of the sub-plots, the storyline is reassuringly familiar.\n",

      "Review 1199: \n",
      " There's a refreshing gender balance among the key characters. Laura Dern's Vice Admiral Holdo may be dressed more for the opera but don't be fooled, kids.\n",
      "Review 1200: \n",
      " Bottom line: \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" may not be the best installment in the now 40-year-old franchise, but it packs enough action and surprises to keep fans happy through the Christmas season and beyond.\n",
      "Review 1201: \n",
      " [Daisy] Ridley already proved herself a worthy addition to the Star Wars fold and does nothing here to convince us that we weren't right to welcome her for what evidently will be a long run.\n",

      " It's full of moments both thrilling and poignant, with anticipated reunions and goodbyes, and pulse-pounding action.\n",
      "Review 1204: \n",
      " While The Last Jedi acknowledges the inevitable comparisons to [The Empire Strikes Back] by setting up some similar scenarios, it then does original and surprising things with those moments.\n",
      "Review 1205: \n",
      " Entertains as comfort food in filmic form, but this is an altogether slighter experience than the spectacular one \"The Force Awakens\" provided. This is a fine film in spite of its many issues, easily recommendable to fans.\n",

      " The last act overcomes a sluggish middle and is as thrilling as this franchise ever gets.\n",
      "Review 1207: \n",
      " The Last Jedi delivers the all-too-rare thrill of a huge popcorn movie that respects the intelligence of its audience, while also serving up plenty of moments designed to make them lose their damn minds.\n",
      "Review 1208: \n",
      " It's a compelling feature for the most part, but it's too obsessed with surprises, often sacrificing stability just to rattle fans.\n",
      "Review 1209: \n",
      " Gorgeous cinematography, solid performances & one of the best scenes in Star Wars history. Though, it has issues incl. unnecessary comedy that affects tone. Liked but didn't love.\n",
      "Review 1210: \n",
      " Regardless of the jokes and explicit exposition, there was enough real emotion to make me care. Given the absolute ridiculousness of what happens in this unapologetic space soap opera, making me feel anything at all is an undeniable measure of success.\n",
      "Review 1211: \n",
      " So much movie, I think my engorged eyeballs had to stick a finger down their throats and vomit out a couple of epic battle scenes just so they could get through the finale.\n",

      " Long, meandering and constantly looping back onto itself - which is less fan service than just a lack of cleverness.\n",

      " \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" is a lot of fun, a genuine achievement and a great way to spend a couple of hours at the theater... But once the stardust settles, we'll probably still admit that the original trilogy is just never going to be matched.\n",

      " The Rise of Skywalker has only managed to forget to make itself feel important, and as a result, ends the Skywalker Saga with a film of wondrous moments that becomes hollow when viewed as part of something larger.\n",
      "Review 2234: \n",
      " Those hoping for surprises, meaningful story arcs, engaging set pieces, and characters worth a damn, should shrug it off. The franchise that reimagined cinema and earned a second life is spinning its wheels in the coarse sand again.\n",
      "Review 2235: \n",
      " It is an act of cowardice that sees a beloved nine-film saga sputter to a hugely disappointing and unaffecting end. Congratulations, internet. You killed the thing you, ahem, loved.\n",
      "Review 2236: \n",
      " The Rise of Skywalker captivates with its alluring special effects, but it is a finale that infuriates to the extent that you literally don't care anymore. Why settle for a saturated and uneven reboot of Return of the Jedi?\n",
      "Review 2237: \n",
      " A mostly terrible movie with some admittedly great moments, you'd be better off skipping Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and binge-watching a few episodes of The Mandalorian instead.\n",

      " The Force is strong indeed with this final chapter of the triple trilogy...the film delivers on all fronts, combining eye-boggling visuals with a meaty central storyline loaded with a series of resounding emotional thunder bolts. It's quite a ride.\n",

      "Review 2249: \n",
      " You don't need a reason to see The Rise of Skywalker, but if you did, it would be Daisy Ridley. Her fierce commitment to playing Rey with integrity, intelligence and a total understanding of the kind of film she's in lifts her every scene.\n",
      "Review 2250: \n",

      "Review 2305: \n",
      " I detested J.J Abrams' \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" (TROS). It's a shell of a film, more machine now than ever. A twisted wreck of fan service, messy assembly of conveniences, lazy echoes and callbacks crashing into an aborted conclusion.\n",

      " George Lucas' 1977 original A New Hope was hokey and badly written but had a kind of seat-of-the-pants magic about it. It also had soul, something this film utterly lacks.\n",
      "Review 2339: \n",
      " I didn't approach this film with a checklist of do's and don'ts. I just wanted to enjoy myself, and I did, albeit with reservations. I think the assets far outweigh the liabilities and fully expectitto be a giant crowd-pleaser.\n",
      "Review 2340: \n",
      " The film is not without thrills and is definitely an amusing jaunt for the most part once you don't think too hard about who, what or why.\n",
      "Review 2341: \n",
      " It is shocking, truly shocking, how abjectly The Rise of Skywalker fails. Even the prequels, as shoddy as they were, at least offered something approaching a creative vision.\n",
      "Review 2342: \n",
      " The spectacle is splendid and the actors agreeable.\n",
      "Review 2343: \n",
      " The Rise of Skywalker entertains, it elicits laughters, and it makes you feel even as you snicker at some predictably basic and occasionally nonsensical story decisions.\n",
      "Review 2344: \n",
      " Imperfect as it is, The Rise of Skywalker often feels like being wrapped up in a warm blanket. It's not a risky venture, but it has enough heart to power a galaxy. And that makes for a fitting ending in my book.\n",
      "Review 2345: \n",
      " It's at a constant screech, which is numbing and dull, and results in an unemotional end to an otherwise harmless saga.\n",
      "Review 2346: \n",
      " A succession of decisions aimed at mitigating fans' malicious whims. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Review 2347: \n",
      " Not so much a continuation, but a tangent, an almost complete erasure of the bold choices made by Rian Johnson which dared to expand the series' horizons, but Abrams has never been able to resist the dark power of the nostalgia. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Review 2348: \n",
      " The Rise of Skywalker has its issues and J.J. Abrams plays it too safe, but it remains an entertaining film that families and friends can enjoy together for years to come.\n",
      "Review 2349: \n",
      " Clunky and bit complex, JJ Abrams does the impossible with trying to end the \"Star Wars\" saga with the competent and enjoyable \"The Rise of Skywalker\" but it ends up playing it safe and not taking enough narrative risks to stick a perfect landing.\n",
      "Review 2350: \n",
      " An extravaganza of fan service, exposition, and leaden, McGuffin-based plotting. There are some nice moments, though.\n",
      "Review 2351: \n",
      " The Force was not with director/co-writer J.J. Abrams, who attacks the franchise with everything he's got, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker still misses its target.\n",
      "Review 2352: \n",
      " An accomplished end to a culturally significant saga, but let's hope we can now draw a line.\n",
      "Review 2353: \n",
      " Frustratingly uneven but it's still STAR WARS and still very watchable.\n",
      "Review 2354: \n",
      " It's very much time to put the Skywalkers to bed, at last, and free up the galaxy for entirely new possibilities. The force is strong with them, and all of that, but it's clear that there's nothing more to see here.\n",
      "Review 2355: \n",
      " J.J. Abrams's mechanical, nonsensical Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker contains so many resurrections it's a wonder Disney and Lucasfilm didn't push back the release date from Christmas to Easter.\n",
      "Review 2356: \n",
      " I don't go into a Star Wars movie with the fear that my childhood will be ruined if the moviemakers give Boba Fett the wrong color headpiece, so for me The Rise of Skywalker (dumb title, by the way) played just fine as a sci-fi spectacle.\n",
      "Review 2357: \n",
      " It is, at best, \"fine.\" And that's really what you want in a conclusion to a beloved, sometimes personality-defining series that has spanned more than 40 years, right? \"Fine.\"\n",
      "Review 2358: \n",
      " If you disliked \"The Last Jedi\" (like I did), you'll like - but probably not love - \"The Rise of Skywalker.\" If you liked \"The Last Jedi,\" this review might not be for you.\n",
      "Review 2359: \n",
      " Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker often touches the childlike innocence lost amongst cynical adults.\n",
      "Review 2360: \n",
      " An intense and extremely emotional experience that falls apart when analysed. It's not a disaster, but it works better emotionally than rationally. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Review 2361: \n",
      " It ends just as predictably as it began, a trilogy of \"Star Wars\" movies built on George Lucas's Greatest Hits.\n",
      "Review 2362: \n",
      " A gracious exit to the sags George Lucas unveiled 42 years ago. The nostalgic and sentimental film isn't concerned with breaking new ground as it is with bidding farewell.\n",
      "Review 2363: \n",
      " The Rise of Skywalker is a pitiful attempt to wrap up all nine films, an experience so whittled down by the corporate process that it falls completely flat.\n",
      "Review 2364: \n",
      " ...Disney can move on with the real work now, picking the bones of whatever ephemera we comfortably identify as being \"Star Wars\" and repackaging it carefully so as to 1) sell Funko Pops and 2) try not to piss off anybody.\n",
      "Review 2365: \n",
      " (Like the) Falcon... in the film, the nigh-impossible task of trying to please (most) everybody is navigated with finesse amidst the bombast of a fitting conclusion.\n",
      "Review 2366: \n",
      " The Rise of Skywalker is thrilling, emotional, and poignant. It really is the perfect ending to the Skywalker Saga.\n",
      "Review 2367: \n",
      " Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an emotionally charged, visually stunning, and action packed close to the epic story that still manages to disappoint. It pandered to fans at the expense of telling a compelling story.\n",
      "Review 2368: \n",
      " Like a ride in the Millennium Falcon: Rickety, often misguided and often seeming like it's about to fall apart at any moment. But the sucker sure does move fast and keep things exciting.\n",
      "Review 2369: \n",
      " Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker lifts our spirits just enough.\n",
      "Review 2370: \n",
      " Thrilling, charming, at times cheezy - like all Star Wars films - convenient, and wonderful throughout. Kudos to Ridley for putting a daunting franchise on her back.\n",
      "Review 2371: \n",
      " Abrams and company is sloppily pulling strings to reach their safe conclusion of sacrifice, faith, and convenience. It admittedly works regardless of whether it resonates.\n",
      "Review 2372: \n",
      " I detested J.J Abrams' \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" (TROS). It's a shell of a film, more machine now than ever. A twisted wreck of fan service, messy assembly of conveniences, lazy echoes and callbacks crashing into an aborted conclusion.\n",
      "Review 2373: \n",
      " All I know is when that amazing music begins, along with the scroll of \"A galaxy far, far away\", I'm in movie heaven!\n",
      "Review 2374: \n",
      " At the center of it all is Daisy Ridley as Rey. She is a true warrior and a credible heroine that we can all admire.\n",
      "Review 2375: \n",
      " There's something very off about The Rise of Skywalker. It sort of all just happens. There was no build-up, no suspense. There's nothing to experience and I want a star war to be an experience.\n",
      "Review 2376: \n",
      " \"Star Wars\" is, and has been, a very important and memorable part of my life and I must say that \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" is the perfect ending to my childhood!\n",
      "Review 2377: \n",
      " When we meet up with brash pilot Poe, he's lightspeed-skipping his way out of trouble, and Abrams is in much the same mode, whisking you from one thing to the next before you have much time to think or feel anything in response.\n",
      "Review 2378: \n",
      " Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker has several mind blowing revelations & action from beginning to end. Ties everything together in a neat little bow while fixing past issues.\n",
      "Review 2379: \n",
      " The hermetic logic of the plot is as impeccable as it is ridiculous. It's a drama crafted with robotic insularity for the consumption of viewers being rendered robotic at each moment of the soullessly uniform spectacle.\n",
      "Review 2380: \n",
      " The script by Abrams and Chris Terrio has so much ground to cover that the enterprise becomes a manic exercise trying to fit in plot points while stuffing the screen with hyper-battles, light speed space travel, and audio pounding explosions.\n",
      "Review 2381: \n",
      " Just a shame, then, that [Rey's] story should have so little emotional resonance, and that the Skywalker saga, with its 42 years of cinematic tradition, should end on such a charmless whimper.\n",
      "Review 2382: \n",
      " It is a grand entertainment for sure, even as we feel a scorecard is required and the uninitiated may feel lost in space.\n",
      "Review 2383: \n",
      " Diehard fans might be happy, but I found \"Rise of Skywalker\" just okay and clearly the lesser of the most recent \"Star Wars\" films. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Scary Scenes, Profanity, etc. - also Available)\n",
      "Review 2384: \n",

    "### As you can see the words represented in the word cloud do tell us a bit about the overall reviews given to each of those movies. I do understand that the most used words are for the movie name itself and I could have decided to drop them, but since it makes it easier for the viewer to understand which wordcloud belongs to which movie, thus I kept it as is. For the part how effective the wordcloud is taking the example of the 3rd wordcloud, it appears the type of words shown to some extent share the sentiment of the viewers, as the movie was considered a bit fun and satistying. This can also be confirmed from the sentiment anaylsis performed in the previous section, which did conclude this movie having a lot of postive reveiws. Overall, I would say the wordcloud does represent the sentiment of the critic and provides us with a basic idea how the movie was precieved by the audience.   "

    "### Based on the similarity analysis performed above, it appears that, there is very minute similarity between the top 8 critics who have written a review on  Solo: A Star Wars Story. The highest cosine similarity exists between James Berardinelli and Jeffrey M. Anderson i.e. 0.1523. To confirm if the results for this consine similarity analysis are reliable, I researched on these two critics and it turns out that both of them are among the top registered critics of at Rotton Tomatos. Superisingly most of the scores/ratings given by both these critics tend to similar. Also I read few of there reviews for other movies as well and it turns out they do have a bit of similarity in the tone voice. The analyis performed above to uncover this pattern of similarity is a very basic one, even though it does give us some insights but in order to completely understand the association between critics, we will need to perform this analysis over and over again on reviews provided on other movies to have a deep understanding of what is going on. But overall this analysis provides us with a decent starting point and a reliable direction for future analysis. "

    "### Upon completing the analysis, I believe we do have a basic understanding of the overall sentiment the movies reviews have within this dataset. I agree the dataset appears to be tempered or a bit imbalance or compromised due to more positive sentiments and to have a more concerete results quality of data can be improved. Also what could have been done differently to improve my results with the given data, I could have choosen to filter the reviews that have less than 15 words. This would have helped in terms of having a dataset which has more thoughtful and crediable reveiws. Also I could have tried to translate all the reviews provided in forign language to english rather than dropping them from the main dataset."
